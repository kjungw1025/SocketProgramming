Adele - When We Were Young
Let me photograph you in this light
In case it is the last time
that we might be exactly like we were
Before we realized
We were sad of getting old
It mad us restless
Oh, I'm so mad I'm getting old
It makes me reckless
It was just like a movie
It was just like a song
When we were young
